### Hi, I'm Fachry — a software engineer.

I currently work full-time as a **Pranata Komputer at Diskominfo Buol**, where I manage servers and contribute to the development of various software solutions. In addition to my main role, I also work as a **contract Software Engineer at [AI-Lab](https://ai-lab.id)**, focusing on building and improving AI-driven products.

Beyond my full-time commitments, I remain active as a **freelance developer**, handling projects in:

- Frontend development (Web & Mobile)  
- Backend development  
- Fullstack application development

My journey in software development began in 2022 while I was still in university, and since then I’ve been involved in building and maintaining applications for clients across different sectors.
